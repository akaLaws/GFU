            <h2>Coffee addicted fullstacking teacher</h2>
            <p>
                With a background in business development as well as programming and parenting am I equiped to adapt any plan after a full frontal collision with reality. 
                What I love about programming whether it's for hardware, software or web is that it's a way to bring a system to an abstract concept and give structure to chaos.
                A way to implement every tool learned from art analysis, physics, history, math and languages. 
                What I love about the technical approach to education is the way the answer for WHY we need to learn these subjects are answered through the implementation of HOW to use the tools and knowledge provided.
                Allthough in a way not obviously aparent when these was tought. 
                Seeing the correlations, connections and the relevans between each is when theory is translated to creativity and application. 
                Teaching how to be curious, creative and courageus in the approach to learning, life and any adversity is my main approach to ready my student for life after school.
